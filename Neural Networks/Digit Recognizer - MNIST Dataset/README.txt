This project uses artificial neural networks to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST digit database. The project was completed as part of a Machine Learning course at Davidson College. Experiments were performed within the algorithm to determine optimal values for various hyperparameters and learning functions.

Authors: Alden Hart and Samuel Castle

The MNIST database is available here:

The final model was submitted to a practice contest on <http://www.kaggle.com>, a site for predictive data analytics and machine learning competitions.
