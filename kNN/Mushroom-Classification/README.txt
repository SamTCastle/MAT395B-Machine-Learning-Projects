The dataset includes examples of mushrooms with values for various attributes. Each mushroom is labeled poisonous or edible. The task is to set aside a reserved set of examples for testing, train a rule to predict whether a new mushroom is poisonous or edible, and test the classifier on the reserved data.

The dataset is from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom.
