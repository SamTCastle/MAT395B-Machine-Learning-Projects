This project uses artificial neural networks to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST digit database. The project was completed as part of a Machine Learning course at Davidson College. Experiments were performed within the algorithm to determine optimal values for various hyperparameters and learning functions.

Authors: Alden Hart and Samuel Castle

The MNIST database is available here:

The final model will be submitted to a practice contest on <http://www.kaggle.com>, a site for predictive data analytics and machine learning competitions.

PyBrain, an open source machine learning library for neural networks was used in this project. More info on PyBrain can be found on <http://www.pybrain.org> and with the following reference:
